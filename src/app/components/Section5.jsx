              In 1995, Hielke Dijkstra founded Trios, driven by an initial
              customer demand. His philosophy from day one? Keep surprising your
              customer positively with thoughtful designs that result in the
              most beautiful collaborations. Or as Hielke often said: “The
              customer shouldn't want that...”.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[22px] text-[#7c7f8d] leading-snug opacity-80 mb-6">
              Thanks to its approach and choices, Trios is now a valued
              engineering firm with a strong team and modern facilities. Since
              2016, Erik and Marc have continued their work with the same
              vision.
